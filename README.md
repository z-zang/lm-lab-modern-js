# Modern JavaScript

🤖 Modern JavaScript: In-session Refactoring Lab

## Instructions

On your own, in groups or in pairs, work through the JavaScript files and refactor them using the suggested modern JavaScript method specified in the document.

✅ Be sure to read the accompanying instructions in the md files

✅ If the exercise has tests, be sure to check the tests still pass after you've refactored the code! (💡 To do this, run `npm test`!)

✅ Once completed, be ready to explain what you did back to the rest of the cohort.

## Contents

We recommend the concepts worked on and then discussed with the class, are grouped together as so:

1. [Functions 1 & 2](modern_javascript_exercises/functions/functions_1.md), [Default Parameters](modern_javascript_exercises/default_parameters/default_parameters.md) and [Variables](modern_javascript_exercises/variables/let_vs_var.md)

2. Destructuring [Arrays](modern_javascript_exercises/destructuring_arrays/destructuring_arrays.md) and [Objects](modern_javascript_exercises/destructuring_objects/destructuring_objects.md)

3. [Rest](modern_javascript_exercises/rest_parameters/rest_parameters.md) and [Spread](modern_javascript_exercises/spread_syntax/spread_syntax.md) syntax (…)

4. [Template Literals](modern_javascript_exercises/template_literals/template_literals.md) and [Ternaries](modern_javascript_exercises/ternaries/ternaries.md)

5. [Imperative vs Declarative Programming](modern_javascript_exercises/declarative_vs_imperative/declarative_vs_imperative.md)

## Tips and Tricks

💡 If you've not heard of the modern JavaScript method before, that's great! Google and read about the method before having a go at implementing it. The [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) are a great resource.

💡 Your understanding is the most important thing, so take your time.

💡 Researching, writing notes and solving problems yourself will help you learn the most.

💡 If you get stuck, ask one of the Tech Coaches and we'll jump in and help! 🙌
