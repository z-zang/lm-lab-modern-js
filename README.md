## Tips and Tricks

ðŸ’¡ If you've not heard of the modern JavaScript method before, that's great! Google and read about the method before having a go at implementing it. The [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) are a great resource.

ðŸ’¡ Your understanding is the most important thing, so take your time.

ðŸ’¡ Researching, writing notes and solving problems yourself will help you learn the most.

ðŸ’¡ If you get stuck, ask one of the Tech Coaches and we'll jump in and help! ðŸ™Œ
