# Modern JavaScript

🤖 Modern JavaScript: In-session Refactoring Lab

## Instructions

On your own, in groups or in pairs, work through the JavaScript files and refactor them using the suggested modern JavaScript method specified in the document.

✅ Be sure to read the accompanying instructions in the md files

✅ If the exercise has tests, be sure to check the tests still pass after you've refactored the code! (💡 To do this, run `npm test`!)

✅ Once completed, be ready to explain what you did back to the rest of the cohort.

## Contents

We recommend working through the files in the order below:

1. [Functions 1](modern_javascript_exercises/functions/functions_1.md),

## Tips and Tricks

💡 If you've not heard of the modern JavaScript method before, that's great! Google and read about the method before having a go at implementing it. The [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) are a great resource.

💡 Your understanding is the most important thing, so take your time.

💡 Researching, writing notes and solving problems yourself will help you learn the most.

💡 If you get stuck, ask one of the Tech Coaches and we'll jump in and help! 🙌
