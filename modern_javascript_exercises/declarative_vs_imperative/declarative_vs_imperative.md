# Imperative vs Declarative Programming

“Declarative Programming's... main goal is to describe the desired result without direct dictation on how to get it.” - GeeksforGeeks

As the JavaScript language has developed, it has moved away from imperative methods, abstracting complexity away "under the hood".

Modern JavaScript is a lot more _declaritive_.

For example, an example of an imperative programming method would be a forLoop:

```JavaScript

// Here we are using a forLoop to explain step by step, *exactly* what our program should do

const people = ["Barry", "Gary", "Larry"]

for(let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
    console.log(people[i])
}

```

If we refactored the forLoop above into something more _declarative_, it would look something like this:

```JavaScript

// We are using forEach
// We don't care about the individual steps needed (let i = 0; i < people.length etc) to get what we want - they are hidden away
// forEach is more descriptive, it *sounds* more like what we want to do...

const people = ["Barry", "Gary", "Larry"]

people.forEach((person) => console.log(person))

```

Considering that declarative programming means "abstracting away complexity", consider how you would refactor the function
`longPasswords()` so it uses _declarative_ methods to get the same result.

To run the tests:

            npm test declarative_programming.test.js

Hint: make sure you're in the correct folder before running this command! 😉

Note: there is a place for both imperative and declarative styles of programming. However, declarative programming is often favoured for being more readable.
