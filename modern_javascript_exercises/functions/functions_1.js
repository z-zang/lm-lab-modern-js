// Function Declarations
// logPerson() is a "Function Declaration"
// Note how it uses the "function" keyword at the beginning of it's declaration
// This is the original way of writing functions in JavaScript

const people = ["Harry", "Hermione", "Ron"];

function logPerson(person) {
  console.log("The person is " + person);
}

people.forEach(logPerson);

// Function in a Variable
// Store the logPerson() function in a variable called performLogPerson

const performLogPerson = function (person) {
  console.log("The person is " + person);
}

// Arrow Functions in a Variable
// Write a version of logPerson() as an Arrow Function and store it in a variable called arrowVersionOfLogPerson

const arrowVersionOfLogPerson = (person) => {
  console.log("The person is " + person);
}

// Anonymous Arrow Functions
// Replace logPerson below with an Anonymous Arrow Function that does the same thing!

people.forEach((person) => {console.log("The person is " + person)});

// In JavaScript there are lots of ways to write functions. There is no right or wrong way, but arrow functions are the most modern. ðŸ™‚
